## Description
  Planning Algorithms is a Repository that is a collection of Algorithms used in Planning. Several different types of planning algorithms
  will be addressed. Some of the planning algorithms included in this Repository are:

* **Path Finding**: A*, BFS, DFS, Dijkstra  
* **Scheduling**: Nurse Scheduling Problem  
* **SAT Solvers**: DPLL
* **Intelligent Planning:** STRIPS, Hierarchical Planning

## Project Progress
This project is in it's infancy, it is currently does not have very many algorithms in the library.

## How to use this
To use _Planning-Algorithms_, it is as simple as cloning the repo to a local machine, and running whichever algorithm on your local machine.

## Technologies-Used
Project is created with:
* Python version: 3.6.6
